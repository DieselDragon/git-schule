Been distracted by a number of other projects recently, which has meant my Git has gone a bit on the stale side alas. Also been struggling to manage on a few other fronts, so new projects and code might be a bit slow in coming for the time being. :-o

Still: It's been a good one so far, even if I still find the basic concept behind GitHub a bit difficult to understand and work with. That said it would probably help if I logged-in and contributed to other projects a little more frequently than I do at present! :-p

Anyhow...I've been up for quite a long time and I'm finding myself a bit on the sleeeepy side now, so I think it's time to log-out before I start typing raw Assembler or - Worse - VB! But before I do, there's one last thing I need to add...

# A most Bright and Blessed Yule, a very Merry Christmas, and a Happy New Year to one and all! ^_^ >:-)
