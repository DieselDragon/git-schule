It's been quite a while since I was last here (Four years, in fact!) - Mainly because of concerns over how Brexit and potential new rules in a certain left-hand driving country might impact my right to privacy and protection of my own information 🇬🇧 - But after four years of slumber I'm finally back again, at least for the moment! 🙂

I have a few projects presently on the go, with the current focus being on some ICT factsheets I'm creating for a computer mentoring group that I'm helping out with. 📜 🖥️ 🔰

Since I was last here I have *finally* been fortunate enough to get connected-up with some local Orienteering clubs (Yes; Good things can happen, even in a lockdown!) so it should come as no surprise I'm more likely to be seen with a compass than a computer whenever I have a choice between them. I have a Git'able project in mind in that regard too (It may be familiar to anybody who knows *Odots*) so watch this space! 🧭 🇬🇫 😸

# Keep your map to the North, your Compass in hand, and keep on running! 🏃 ❤️ 🤘

Been distracted by a number of other projects recently, which has meant my Git has gone a bit on the stale side alas. Also been struggling to manage on a few other fronts, so new projects and code might be a bit slow in coming for the time being. :-o

Still: It's been a good one so far, even if I still find the basic concept behind GitHub a bit difficult to understand and work with. That said it would probably help if I logged-in and contributed to other projects a little more frequently than I do at present! :-p

Anyhow...I've been up for quite a long time and I'm finding myself a bit on the sleeeepy side now, so I think it's time to log-out before I start typing raw Assembler or - Worse - VB! But before I do, there's one last thing I need to add...

# A most Bright and Blessed Yule, a very Merry Christmas, and a Happy New Year to one and all! ^_^ >:-)
