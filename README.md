# DieselDragon's About-Me with a bit more detail
### Incorporating: Finding my feet with GitHub, and my first ever commit(ment)!

So this is me, **DieselDragon**, yet another random coder and one of the many who'll often stay up until the stupidly small hours doing nothing but staring at a bash shell and keeping the neighbours awake with his keyboard. :-)

Massive fan of Metal (Whether classic 80s 'Maiden, or the truly Thunderous works of Alstom *ahem* Alestorm! ;-) and it has been said I ought to be *obscene and not heard* at times. Also like other types of music too, ranging across the genres. Love 90's Techno and a bit of pop besides! :-o :-p

Also a **massive** railway enthusiast, with a *very* strong love of just anything which rolls out of AleStorms' *ahem* Alstoms' sheds! Because we all know that life is **#BetterFaster** with Alstom, and **#BetterThunder** makes for a Better Life! :-)

**Vive le TGV! \m/ \m/ \m/ >:-)**
